# probability_calculator
Defines a Hat class that represents a hat with different colored balls and provides methods to draw balls from the hat. 
The experiment function simulates drawing balls from the hat multiple times and calculates the probability of achieving a specific combination of drawn balls. 
The code at the end of the script demonstrates how to use the Hat and experiment functions to estimate the probability of a certain outcome.
